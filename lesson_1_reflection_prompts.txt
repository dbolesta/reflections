was introduced?

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    So you can see all of your old work 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually committing allows you to keep documented track of what edits are being made,
    by who, and for what purpose. Automatic saving is more of a safe-guard against 
    simply forgetting to save a document on a regular basis.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because for many projects, multiple files are contributing to one project

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You would use `git log` to see every commit ever made to the file, and if you wanted
    to see actual specific differences, you would use `git diff id1 id2` to see what
    lines were added and which lines were deleted

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If you end up breaking something, version control allows you to easily revert
    back to a version before the breaking happened

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Quinciple!!
